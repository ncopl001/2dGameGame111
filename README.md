## Pattern: Singleton
### Implementation
[I dont quite understand pattern, but I made it so that the enimes spawn every 5 seconds from the spawners. I then made it so that the player has a spisific shoot time. I also made the game have a serize of obsticals to make the fight more interesting.]

### Game Integration
[ i made a small 2d game where enimes have a script to gradualy go twards the player until the player is killed. I mage it a full game with a title screen and a death screen. I then made the git hub with the video on canvas and ive been trying to add to it.]
